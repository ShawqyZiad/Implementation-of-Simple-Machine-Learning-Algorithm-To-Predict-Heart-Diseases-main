# Implementation of Simple Machine Learning Algorithm To Predict Heart Diseases
 1. Problem Definition
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a person has heart disease or not based on various health indicators (features) such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc.

2. Dataset
You start with a dataset that contains patient records.

Each record has features like:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

Blood pressure

Cholesterol levels

Blood sugar levels

Electrocardiographic results

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

And other relevant medical info

Plus, a target label indicating presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

3. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing data: Fill or remove missing values.

Feature scaling: Normalize or standardize features to bring them to the same scale.

Encoding categorical variables: Convert categorical data (like chest pain type) to numeric form using techniques such as one-hot encoding.

Splitting dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% train, 30% test).

4. Selecting the Algorithm
For a simple project, common algorithms include:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

For example, Logistic Regression is a popular choice for binary classification like heart disease prediction.

5. Training the Model
Use the training data to fit the model.

The model learns the relationship between input features and the target label.

6. Model Evaluation
Test the model on unseen test data.

Calculate metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC Curve

These metrics help to understand how well the model predicts heart disease.

7. Making Predictions
Once trained and evaluated, use the model to predict heart disease on new patient data.

8. (Optional) Model Improvement
Tune hyperparameters to improve performance.

Try other algorithms.

Feature engineering.
